    Test we can create read from the database.

    Specifically this test that:
    1. We can make a query
    2. That an empty db has not been populated
    3. That a populated db has table entries
    4. Check that we can extract the id for a given set of values which exist
    5. Check that no id is returned if a given set of values is not found in the
       database
    6. That we can get the latest row id which has been written to

    Parameters
    ----------
    make_test_database : function
        Function which returns the database connection
    write_to_split : function
        Function returning the database connection where `split` has been populated
