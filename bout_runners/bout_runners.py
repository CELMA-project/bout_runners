    basic_runner
    ------------

    Class for mpi running one or several runs with BOUT++.
    Calling self.execute_runs() will run your BOUT++ program with the possible
    combinations given in the member data using the mpi runner.

    Before each run basic_runner will:
        * Create a folder system, based on the member data, rooted in
          self._directory.
        * Copy BOUT.inp of self._directory to the execution folder.
        * Check that the domain split is sane (suggest a split if a bad
          domain split is given)

    If the restart option is checked, bout_runners will
        * Put old data into a restart folder (so that nothing is lost
          upon restart)
        * Resize the mesh if new sizes are detected

    A log-file for the run is stored in self._directory

    By default self._directory = "data", self._nproc = 1 and
    self._allow_size_modification = False

    self._program_name is by default set to the same name as any .o files in
    thefolder where an instance of the object is created. If none is found the
    constructor tries to run make.

    All other data members are set to None by default.

    The data members will override the corresponding options given in
    self._directory/BOUT.inp.

    See the doctring of the constructor (__int__) for options.
    See BOUT/examples/bout_runners_example for examples.
