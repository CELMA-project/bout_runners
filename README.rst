Manage your BOUT++ runs through python

Overview
--------

BOUT Runners is a package to manage and orchestrate your BOUT++ runs. More
specifically it's a tool:

- Which automatically makes your project
- Where you can override default parameters, and parameters found in ``BOUT.inp``
- Where you can submit a single run, or even a chain of runs
- Which automatically stores parameters and other metadata in a database (inspired by |sacred|_)
- Logs the entire process
